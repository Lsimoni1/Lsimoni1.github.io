    <h2 id = "1"> The Fastest Land Animal</h2>

    <p>
        Capable of going from <strong> 0 to 60 miles per hour </strong> in less than 
        three seconds, the cheetah is considered the fastest land animal,
        though it is able to maintain such speeds only for short distances.

    <h2 id = "2"> The Fastest Land Animal (Long Distances)</h2>

    <p>
      Capable of maintaining a speed of nearly 35 miles per hour over several miles and is 
      even faster over shorter distances. During sprints to elude predators, pronghorns can hit
      top speeds of about <strong>55 miles per hour</strong> thanks to special cushions on their hooves and the ability to 
      take in large quantities of oxygen as they run.

    <h2 id = "3"> The Fastest Fish</h2>

    <p>
      According to some sources, the black marlin is fastest, with an estimated top speed of up to <strong>80 miles per hour</strong>. 
      The sailfish is also a top contender, with an estimated top speed of at least 67 miles per hour.

    <h2 id = "4"> The Fastest Insect</h2>

    <p>
      It is known that the common horsefly can achieve speeds estimated at <strong>90 miles 
      per hour</strong> under certain circumstances, a speed gauged during a scientific experiment.

    <h2 id = "5"> The Fastest Bird</h2>

    <p>
      The peregrine falcon is considered the fastest bird and the fastest member of the animal 
      kingdom, with a flight-diving speed of more than <strong>185 miles per hour</strong> when hunting. Another
       superfast bird is the golden eagle, which dives at 150+ miles per hour.
